BBQ temperature monitoring system

I use a Nutrichef EasyBBQ PWIRBBQ80 6 channel thermometer to monitor the meat and smoker temperatures in my Big Green Egg.  The EasyBBQ phone app is disappointing in that it forgets any logged readings when the Bluetooth link is lost.  You can reconnect Bluetooth but the graph view has no previous data.  This makes it difficult to recognize when meats enter the "stall".

I have a network of smart devices throughout my house.  I've developed it myself as one of my retirement hobbies.  There are several Raspberry Pi computers running code I've written in Python.  Communications between computers and smart devices is by MQTT.
